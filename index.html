            to cutting-edge delivery robots, our dining options are as diverse as they are delicious. Picture yourself
            savoring a piping hot latte from Starbucks, indulging in the crispy goodness of Chick-fil-A, or savoring the
            bold flavors of Panda Express—all conveniently located right on campus. And with a 24/7 dining commons, your
            cravings are always satisfied, day or night.
